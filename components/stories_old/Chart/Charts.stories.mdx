# Welcome to Charts

Under this section you will find all the different data visualization idioms that are available in the EMSE library. These charts are all built ontop of the [recharts](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/recharts) library. Each chart has a unique set of options that can be used to customize the look and feel of the chart.
